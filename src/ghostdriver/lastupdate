    Return Selenium own Java Exception on Failed Cmd.
    
    Selenium server assumes that in the JSON response
    of a failed command, the “class” field returns the
    fully qualified name of the Java Exception the
    Server is supposed to map the error to.
    
    A very “cavalier” behaviour that I have changed
    in Selenium (see https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=4959695b2267deb16d829290d47c73e829c59422).
    But, in the meantime, I decide I’d make GhostDriver
    comply: so far I haven’t really used that field
    to report anything useful, so it’s OK to change.
    
    Fixes #354.
